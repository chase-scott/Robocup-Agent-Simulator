# Robocup-Agent-Simulator

We introduce a BDI model tailored for RoboCup 
teams through the utilization of the Jason BDI framework. This 
approach is aimed at defining agents by employing belief and 
desire sets to guide intention selection.

Our focus lies in outlining a software architecture using Jason for 
this purpose. The model is structured to create two distinct agent
roles â€“ keeper and striker - by formulating agent speak code that 
are unique for each role. 

The framework facilitates the reasoning process based on beliefs and 
desires, resulting in varied agent behaviors even when faced with 
identical perceptions. Future work involves the handling of more 
percept information to create more complex behaviors between agents.
